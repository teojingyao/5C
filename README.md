# Dear Mr Ikmal,
Thank you so much for all of your effort put into making every lesson fun and enjoyable as much as possible! To motivate students, you created the "Student of the Month", "Perfect Worksheet", and "Survived a Tough Page" and more! I can imagine how classes will be very boring to everyone without all of these put up! HBL is also very tough to everyone, but you did not give up and work day and night trying to help us! I hope that you can be my form teacher again next year! 

# Dear Ms Tan
Thanks for teaching me FTGP and be with us for the flag raising ceremony! You make them fun and enjoyable by showing us external videos you found, and making the class a happy and fun learning environment! I also really enjoyed the MTL Books Alive stay-back activities! I appreciate that you and the other teachers make MTL Lessons fun and enjoyable and still allow us to learn about many different things that happen in the past! I hope that you can be my form teacher again next year ï¼ˆand maybe teach me chinese????)

# From Jing Yao, to the wonderful teachers of 5 Confidence.



Have an enjoyable holiday and an early Happy Christmas!
